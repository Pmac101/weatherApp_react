 This project is a simple weather app using React along with Axios to handle the API. The user can enter the name of a city in the input box and then press the enter button on their keyboard. The app will then retrieve and display the weather data of the chosen city. The purpose of this project was primarily to familiarize myself with React and to serve as a stepping stone to an older project I'd like to recreate.
